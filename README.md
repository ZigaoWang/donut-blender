# Donut Made By Blender

Welcome to the **Donut Made By Blender** project! This repository showcases my journey of learning Blender through a fun and engaging donut rendering project. 

## About the Project

This project is inspired by the popular Blender tutorial on YouTube by [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv9p3x85Ty0). The goal is to create a realistic 3D donut, starting from basic modeling to final rendering.

## Tutorial

I am following this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv9p3x85Ty0) to learn the various aspects of Blender, including:
- **Modeling:** Creating the basic shape of the donut.
- **Texturing:** Adding realistic textures to the donut and icing.
- **Lighting:** Setting up lighting to enhance the realism.
- **Rendering:** Finalizing the project with high-quality rendering techniques.

## Preview

Here is a preview of my progress so far:

## Future Improvements

As I continue learning, I plan to:
- Refine the textures and materials for more realism.
- Experiment with different lighting setups.
- Try out various rendering techniques to improve the final output.
- Add animations to make the final result as a video.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through the tutorial and improve my Blender skills!
